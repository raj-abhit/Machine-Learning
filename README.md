# Laptop-Price-Prediction

# 📘 Introduction
The laptop market is diverse with numerous configurations, brands, and specifications, making accurate price prediction challenging for both buyers and sellers. However, challenges like rapidly changing technology, varying brand values, and complex feature combinations often hinder fair pricing decisions. This project introduces a machine learning-based laptop price prediction system designed to estimate appropriate laptop prices based on technical specifications and features.

Unlike traditional valuation methods, this system utilizes regression models and feature engineering techniques. These models are particularly effective at recognizing patterns and complex relationships in hardware specifications, making them ideal for this application.

# 🎯 Objectives
Predict laptop prices based on input features: Processor type, RAM capacity, storage size, display specifications, brand, and other technical features.

Train and evaluate multiple regression models to estimate laptop prices from predefined specifications.

Analyze the model's performance using standard regression metrics:

✅ Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
✅ Mean Squared Error (MSE)
✅ R-squared Score
✅ Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

This system aims to empower consumers and retailers with data-driven pricing insights, leading to informed purchasing decisions and optimal pricing strategies.

# ⚙️ Technologies Used
Python
Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
Pandas (for data manipulation)
Numpy (for numerical operations)
Streamlit (for web application interface)
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)

# 📊 Model Evaluation
The model's performance is rigorously assessed using standard regression metrics, which may include:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average absolute difference between predictions and actual values.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average squared difference between predictions and actual values.
R-squared Score: Proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Square root of the average squared differences.

# 🚀 Streamlit Web Application
The project includes an interactive Streamlit web application that allows users to:

Input laptop specifications through a user-friendly interface

Get real-time price predictions

Visualize feature importance and model insights

Compare different laptop configurations and their estimated prices
