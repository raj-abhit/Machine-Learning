# Farmers-Crop-Recommendation-System

# 📘 Introduction
Agriculture is crucial for global food security and livelihoods. However, challenges like unpredictable weather, soil degradation, and poor crop selection often hinder optimal productivity. This project introduces an AI-powered crop recommendation system designed to suggest the most suitable crop for cultivation based on environmental and soil conditions.

Unlike traditional machine learning methods, this system utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. LSTMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) particularly effective at recognizing patterns and complex dependencies in sequential data, making them ideal for this application.

# 🎯 Objectives
Recommend the best crop to cultivate based on input features: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall.

Train and evaluate an LSTM model to classify the optimal crop from a predefined list.

Analyze the model's performance using standard classification metrics:

✅ Accuracy

✅ Precision

✅ Recall

✅ F1-score

✅ Confusion Matrix

This system aims to empower farmers and agricultural planners with data-driven insights, leading to improved crop yields and fostering sustainable farming practices.


# ⚙️ Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow/Keras (for LSTM model)

Pandas (for data manipulation)

Numpy (for numerical operations)

Scikit-learn (for evaluation metrics)


# 📊 Model Evaluation
The model's performance is rigorously assessed using standard classification metrics, which may include:

Accuracy: Overall correctness of predictions.

Precision: The proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.

Recall: The proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly.

F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
